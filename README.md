# Compose Movie Search
This is a simple Android application showing a list of movies, with an ability to search
through the list. It's written using Jetpack Compose and contains an MVVM / MVI-"ish"
architecture that I'm currently experimenting with and have found to work well with Compose.

Running it locally
------------------
1. Download Android Studio Arctic Fox Beta 4 (Android studio [archive](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive)).
1. Open the root `build.gradle` in Android Studio via `File > Open`.
